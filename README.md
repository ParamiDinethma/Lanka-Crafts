# Lanka Crafts – Digital Platform for Traditional Artisans

Lanka Crafts is a comprehensive digital ecosystem designed to empower local Sri Lankan artisans by connecting them directly with tourists. The platform facilitates workshop discovery, secure bookings, and cultural experience sharing through both web and mobile interfaces.

## 🚀 Project Architecture

The project is built using a centralized backend (REST API) that serves both the web and mobile frontends, ensuring data consistency across all platforms.

* **`/webapp-frontend`**: React.js web application for artisans, tourists, and admins.
* **`/mobileapp-frontend`**: React Native mobile application for on-the-go tourist experiences.

We follow an MVP-based development approach to manage academic deadlines. Key risks such as integration issues and data security are mitigated through centralized API versioning and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

### Why this works for your project:

* **Professional Appearance**: It shows the lecturers that you understand the "Monorepo" structure you just asked about.
* [cite_start]**Evidence of Planning**: It lists the "MVP approach" and "Individual Components," which matches the **Evaluation Criteria** in your assignment brief[cite: 16].
* **Clarity**: It clearly separates the three folders (`backend`, `webapp-frontend`, `mobileapp-frontend`) so any team member can easily understand how to run the project.
